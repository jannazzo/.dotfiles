# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.

# Setup Script
If the repo is cloned to ~/.dotfiles, the script should back up all existing dotfiles to a ~/.dotfiles_old and create symlinks in ~ to the dotfiles in ~/.dotfiles, which are controlled by git.

## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

### .bash_aliases
This is a separate file to store my preferred bash aliases.

## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.

## .gitconfig
This file stores basic git configuration settings.
